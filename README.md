AbstractVM - Epitech 2023
</h1>

</br>


## Done by Killian - Epitech 2023 🎓

This project is a part of the **second** year of Epitech. <br>
We had **1 week** to complete it. 🗓️ <br>

The goal of this project is to create an abstract virtual machine that will **execute simple operations** written in a basic assembly language. <br>
The assembly language of this machine is **stack-based**. <br>
The project is divided into two parts: <br>
- The first part is to create a **stack machine** that will be able to **interpret** the assembly language and execute the operations it finds. <br>
- The second part is to throw **exceptions** when the program encounters an error as a LOT of them are possible. <br>
